#  Specific to RubyMotion (use of CocoaPods):
#
#  We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
#  you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
#  https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control

#  Documentation cache and generated files:
/.yardoc/
/_yardoc/
/doc/
/rdoc/

#  Environment normalization:
/.bundle/
/vendor/bundle
/lib/bundler/man/

#  for a library or gem, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#  intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
Gemfile.lock
# .ruby-version
# .ruby-gemset

#  unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc
